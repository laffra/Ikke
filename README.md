# Ikke
Take back your data!

Ikke produces a local backup of all your data, with fast search on Windows and Mac,
visualizing the connections between de data across various sources.

Why the name Ikke?

    Ikke is a Dutch colloquial/slang word, meaning "I", "Me", or "Myself". 
    It is pronounced as "ik-kuh", and is mainly used in the Dutch phrase
    "Ikke, ikke, ikke, en de rest kan stikken", translated roughly into 
    "Me, me, me, and screw all others".

Ikke consists of various components:
 * Importers for data sources such as browser history, local downloads, gmail, facebook, etc.
 * A Chrome browser extension that helps you track what websites you visited and find them back quickly.
 * A super-fast freetext search backend that runs on your local machine, not needing any cloud access.
 * Smooth graph visualizations that show relationships between various data sources.
