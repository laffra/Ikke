# Ikke
Take back your data!

Ikke produces a local backup of all your data, with fast search on Windows and Mac,
visualizing the connections between de data across various sources.

Why the name Ikke?

    Ikke is a Dutch colloquial/slang word, meaning "I", "Me", or "Myself". 
    It is pronounced as "ik-kuh", and is mainly used in the Dutch narcist phrase
    "Ikke, ikke, ikke, en de rest kan stikken", translated roughly into 
    "Me, me, me, and screw all others".

When [pronounced correctly](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Nl-ikke.ogg),
Ikke sounds a lot like the English word "ticket", if you remove the leading and trailing t's.

Ikke consists of various components:
 * Importers for data sources such as browser history, local downloads, gmail, facebook, etc.
 * A Chrome browser extension that helps you track what websites you visited and find them back quickly.
 * A super-fast freetext search backend that runs on your local machine, not needing any cloud access.
 * Smooth graph visualizations that show relationships between various data sources.
